> üìù This will be a tutorial for Krita. I do not own photoshop, so I cannot give a tutorial for that.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This only works on desktop.

> üìù Please note that my Krita has been changed from the default settings. The background, canvas background, theme, and docker set-up, are not the same as when you first get Krita.

## Download Krita
The first step to using the `.kra` template file is to download Krita. This is what the tutorial will be using and will be what the screenshots show.\
You can download Krita [here](https://krita.org/en/download/krita-desktop/).

## Open the file
Download the `.kra` template file from this folder, then drag-and-drop it into Krita.\

## Paste your flag
Copy your flag from your desired source.\

### If you're using an image from a source such as the [LGBTQIA+ wiki](https://lgbtqia.fandom.com/wiki/), **do not** copy it in its raw form on the page.

Instead, left click the image to see the raw image, then copy that one.\

## Paste the flag in Krita
Once you have your flag in your clipboard, open the Krita file and select the `PUT FLAG HERE` layer. Then, press `Ctrl+V` on your keyboard.\

## Resize the flag
This is the hardest part of the process as some flags cannot be easily resized. Krita makes it easier by automatically snapping the sides of images to the sides of the canvas.\
### If your flag has no special shapes or symbols:
You can resize it normally as shown below.\
