## Other Flags
These are flags that aren't in the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/8w6uVTEnJJ). They are mostly just flags that were made for other people, usually so that they could use them in their own servers, or they may be removed flags.

### Removed Flags
Flags that are marked as removed may have many reasons for being removed. Some examples include:
- Large changes may have been made and re-added as a new flag.
- The flag may have had a previously unknown history that was offensive or not welcome in the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/8w6uVTEnJJ).
- The flag may have been removed from the Discord server due to lack of space, or wanting to make more space.
- We may have simply just changed our minds on adding it.\
> ⚠️ These flags *may* be readded at a later date. Feel free to request them back in the `#flag-requests` channel of our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/8w6uVTEnJJ).
